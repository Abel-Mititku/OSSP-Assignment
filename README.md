## Quick Summary
### A. OS Installation
Installed Rocky Linux 9.5 on VMware with minimal setup, configured network, and resolved installation issues like ISO check and gcc installation.

### B. System Call
Wrote a C program using `execvp()` to demonstrate process replacement. Faced line-ending and compilation issues but fixed them using `dos2unix` and installed `gcc`.
